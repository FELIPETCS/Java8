	 Questions :
	 	  
	 Create static methods for each of the following points in AnswersService.java.
	 Create here unit tests for each created method to test and display results 
	 (Will be better if you create tests in TDD before implementing your service methods):
	 
	 1- Method taking a given list of books and return new list of books
	  	- filtered by years > 1990
	 	- sorted by price (Most expensive on top) 
	 	- if the price is equal then sort by Author name
	  Use GivenDatas.givenBooks() for testing 
	  
	 2- Method taking list of books and return list of countries names of authors without duplicates 
	 	Use GivenDatas.givenBooks() for testing
	 	
	 3- Method taking list of books and return a map Map<Category, Integer>
	    which contains a sum of books prices grouped by Category.
	    Use GivenDatas.givenBooks() for testing 
	 	
	 4- Method taking list of students and return new list of students
	 	- filtered by age > 20 && having at least one book with price > 30
	 	- sorted by age, if the ages are equal then sort by names in reversed alphabetic order
	 	Use GivenDatas.givenStudents() for testing
